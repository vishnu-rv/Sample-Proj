# DevOps Project

This project demonstrates a simple web application built with Node.js and Express, utilizing Stripe for payment processing. It is containerized using Docker and deployed on a Kubernetes cluster. The application serves static HTML pages and handles payment sessions through Stripe.

## Features

- Simple Node.js web server using Express
- Static file serving from a public directory
- Stripe payment integration
- Dockerized application for easy deployment
- Kubernetes deployment for scalability and load balancing

## Prerequisites

Before you begin, ensure you have met the following requirements:

- **Node.js**: v14 or higher
- **Docker**: v20 or higher
- **Kubernetes**: Access to a Kubernetes cluster
- **kubectl**: Command-line tool for Kubernetes
- **Jenkins**: For CI/CD pipeline (optional)

        └── workshop3.html
```

## Environment Variables

Create a `.env` file in the project root directory and add the following environment variables:

```plaintext
SECRET_KEY=<Your Stripe Secret Key>
DOMAIN=http://<Your LoadBalancer IP>
STATIC_DIR=public
```

Replace `<Your Stripe Secret Key>` with your actual Stripe API secret key, and `<Your LoadBalancer IP>` with the LoadBalancer IP provided by your Kubernetes service.

## Installation

1. **Clone the repository:**

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/vishnu-rv/Demo.git
   cd Demo
   ```

2. **Build the Docker image:**

   ```bash
   docker build -t vishnu2117/devops-proj-1:latest .
   ```

3. **Run the application locally (optional):**

   ```bash
   docker run -p 3000:3000 --env-file .env vishnu2117/devops-proj-1:latest
   ```

4. **Deploy to Kubernetes:**

   - Apply the Kubernetes deployment and service configurations:

   ```bash
   kubectl apply -f deployment.yaml
   kubectl apply -f service.yaml
   ```

## Accessing the Application

Once deployed, you can access the application using the LoadBalancer IP assigned to your Kubernetes service. Navigate to `http://<Your LoadBalancer IP>` in your web browser.

## CI/CD Pipeline with Jenkins

To automate the deployment process, you can set up a Jenkins pipeline that builds the Docker image and deploys it to the Kubernetes cluster.
